r"""Support for parsing String expression syntax in core files

FuseSoC core files allow strings matching the following pseudo-BNF:

  exprs ::= expr
          | expr exprs

  expr ::= word
         | conditional

  word ::= [a-zA-Z0-9:<>.\[\]_-,=~/^+]+    (one or more alphanum/special chars)

  conditional ::= condition "?" "(" exprs ")"

  condition ::= "!" word
              | word


A condition of the form "foo ? (bar)" is interpreted as 'if the "foo" flag is
set, then "bar", otherwise nothing'. Similarly, "!foo ? (bar)" is interpreted
as 'if the "foo" flag is not set then "bar", otherwise nothing'.

Expanding some exprs with a set of flags results in a space-separated string
containing each word that matched.

    The idea is that this will be much more efficient to match against tags for
    the vast majority of ASTs, which have many more raw words than they have
    conditions.
