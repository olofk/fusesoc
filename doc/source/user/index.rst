FuseSoC User Guide
##################

The FuseSoC User Guide is aimed at hardware developers utilizing FuseSoC to build and integrate their hardware designs.

**Learn how to use FuseSoC in an existing project.**

Have you checked out a hardware design project that uses FuseSoC and are trying to understand how to build the design?
Get started by :ref:`installing FuseSoC <ug_installation>`, and then have a look at the :ref:`usage documentation <ug_cli>`.

**Add FuseSoC support to your hardware project.**

If you are starting a new hardware design project, or already have source files and are looking for a better way to build your project and integrate third-party components?
Get started by :ref:`installing FuseSoC <ug_installation>`, read a bit about the :ref:`concepts and terminology of FuseSoC <ug_overview>`, and then move on to :ref:`add FuseSoC core description files <ug_build_system>` to your project.
