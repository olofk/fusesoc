This documentation contains material for different audiences.

The :doc:`User Guide <user/index>` explains how to get started with FuseSoC, starting from the installation.

The :doc:`Reference Guide <ref/index>` provides a detailled description of all file formats and APIs.

The :doc:`Developer's Guide <dev/index>` is aimed at developers of FuseSoC itself.
It explains how to set up a development environment, how the source code is structured, and how patches and bug reports can be submitted to the project.
