Development Setup
=================

.. note::

   To make changes to a backend, e.g. to the way a simulator or synthesis tool is called, you need to modify edalize, not fusesoc.
   Edalize is a separate project, see https://github.com/olofk/edalize for more information.

Get the code
------------

The FuseSoC source code is maintained in a git repository hosted on GitHub.
To improve FuseSoC itself, or to test the latest unreleased version, it is necessary to clone the git repository first.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd your/preferred/source/directory
   git clone https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc


Setup development environment
-----------------------------

.. note::

   If you have already installed FuseSoC, remove it first using ``pip3 uninstall fusesoc``.

To develop FuseSoC and test the changes, the fusesoc package needs to be installed in editable or development mode.
In this mode, the ``fusesoc`` command is linked to the source directory, and changes made to the source code are immediately visible when calling ``fusesoc``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install all Python packages required to develop fusesoc
   pip3 install --user -r dev-requirements.txt

   # Install Git pre-commit hooks, e.g. for the code formatter and lint tools
   pre-commit install

   # Install the fusesoc package in editable mode
   pip3 install --user -e .

.. note::

    All commands above use Python 3 and install software only for the current user.
    If, after this installation, the ``fusesoc`` command cannot be found adjust your ``PATH`` environment variable to include ``~/.local/bin``.

After this installation is completed, you can

* edit files in the source directory and re-run ``fusesoc`` to immediately see the changes,
* run the unit tests as outlined in the section below, and
* use linter and automated code formatters.

Formatting and linting code
---------------------------

The FuseSoC code comes with tooling to automatically format code to conform to our expectations.
These tools are installed and called through a tool called `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_.
No setup is required: whenever you do a ``git commit``, the necessary tools are called and your code is automatically formatted and checked for common mistakes.

To check the whole source code ``pre-commit`` can be run directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   # check and fix all files
   pre-commit run -a

Running tests
-------------

The FuseSoC contains unit tests written using the pytest framework.
To run the tests in an isolated environment it is recommended to run pytest through tox, which first creates a package of the source code, installs it, and then runs the tests.
This ensures that packaging and environment errors are less likely to slip through.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd fusesoc/source/directory

   # Run all tests in an isolated environment (recommended)
   tox

   # All arguments passed to tox after -- are passed to pytest directly.
   # E.g. run a single test: use filename::method_name, e.g.
   tox -- tests/test_capi2.py::test_capi2_get_tool --verbose

   # Alternatively, tests can be run directly from the source tree.
   # E.g. to run a single test: use filename::method_name, e.g.
   python3 -m pytest

Refer to the `pytest documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for more information how tests can be run.

.. note::

    In many installations you can replace ``python3 -m pytest`` with the shorter ``pytest`` command.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The FuseSoC documentation (i.e., the thing you're reading right now) is built from files in the ``doc`` directory in the FuseSoC source repository.
The documentation is written `reStructuredText <https://docutils.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`_, and `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ is used to convert the documentation into different output formats, such as HTML or PDF.

The most convenient way of working on documentation is to have a browser window open with the rendered documentation next an editor where you work on the reStructuredText files.
Run the following command to build the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd fusesoc/source/directory
   tox -e doc-autobuild

The documentation is now built and can be accessed in a browser.
Look for a line similar to ``[sphinx-autobuild] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000`` and point your browser to the link, e.g. ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``.

Whenever a change to a documentation file is detected the documentation will be rebuilt automatically and the refreshed in the browser without the need for further manual action (it might take a couple seconds, though).
