sapi (System API) is the format for system description files. Current version is version 1.0. A sapi 1.0 file is identified by the string "SAPI=1" in the beginning of a file. The rest of the file is a standard http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file[INI file] that is compatible with Python's http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html[configparser] module

File location
-------------

sapi 1.0 files must reside in a sub directory of the systems directory and have the same name as the directory with a .system suffix, i.e. <systems_root>/<system_name>/<system_name>.system

.Locations of system description files
========
systems/generic/generic.system

systems/ordb2a/ordb2a.system

File contents
-------------

SAPI 1.0 files are a superset of the CAPI files with additional sections and options needed for the system level. Only sections and options specific to the SAPI files are documented here. Refer to the link:capi.html[CAPI documentation] for the common sections and options
