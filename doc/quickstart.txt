Quick start
-----------

Install by cloning the git repo from https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc, cd into fusesoc and run:

------------------------------------
autoreconf -i && ./configure && make
sudo make install
fusesoc init
------------------------------------

Test your installation by running +fusesoc list-cores+. This should return the list of cores that FuseSoC has found

If you have any of the supported simulators installed, you can try to run a simulation on one of the cores as well. For example, +fusesoc sim --sim=icarus wb_sdram_ctrl+ will run a regression test on the core _wb_sdram_ctrl_ with icarus verilog If you also have Altera Quartus installed, you can try to build an example system. For example, +fusesoc build de0_nano+

+fusesoc --help+ will give you more information on commands and switches
