provider
--------
The provider section gives information on where to find the source code for the core. If the provider section is missing, the core is assumed to be local, with the directory of the .core file as the root directory.

|==============================
|Name | Type | Description
|name | String | The name option selects which provider backend to use. All other provider options are specific to the selected provider. Currently supported backends are github, git, opencores, submodule and url.
